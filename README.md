Refine Projects index with visual tiles
Upgrade the /projects/ section from a basic list to a tile-style grid using shortcodes or a custom layout. Each project could be displayed as a card with title, summary, and optional metadata like tags or thumbnails.

 Introduce custom type: project layout with structured metadata
Consider building a dedicated layout template for projects that includes structured fields in frontmatter such as tech stack, project status, completion %, and milestones. This would allow for dynamic visual representation of progress, filtering by tag, and more consistent presentation across projects.
