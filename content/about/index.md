Hey, I’m Joe Gonwa. I’m a product manager, writer, and runner who builds things on the web and thinks a lot about how we live and work.

This site is my digital workspace: a place for writing, reflections, side projects, and reading logs. I’m interested in systems, technology, and the human condition.
