RecipeScraper is a lightweight tool to import structured recipes into my Notion recipe database. It extracts ingredients, steps, and metadata from popular cooking sites, and formats them into a consistent structure.

I'm using it to cut through bloated food blogs and build a personal, searchable recipe vault. Good bye popup adds and endless scroll!
