# Why I Built the Nobel Laureate Speech Explorer

What if you could ask the greatest literary minds of the past century a questionâ€”any question?

What did Toni Morrison say about justice?  
What themes have Swedish authors explored since the Cold War?  
Could you write a letter in the tone of a Nobel laureate?

I built a tool to do exactly that.

**NobelLM** is a public-facing app that scrapes, structures, and semantically searches over 100 years of Nobel Literature lectures and speeches. Powered by embeddings and generative AI, it allows users to ask rich, open-ended questions and receive grounded responsesâ€”with citations from real source material.

## Why I Chose Literature

When I started this project, I wanted to learn how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems workedâ€”truly, from scratch. At first, I considered financial filings or regulatory documents. But they felt cold, repetitive, and uninspiring.

I've always loved literature. I'm drawn to tone, story, perspective. And I've long found Nobel Prize speeches to be a hidden well of depth and dignityâ€”emotional, political, and sometimes radical.

So I pivoted. I scraped the Nobel archive, normalized the metadata, and started building something that would do justice to the voices inside it.

## My Goals

This project has always been more than a demo. I wanted to:

- **Understand AI systems**: Learn embeddings, chunking, vector search, and prompt design through real implementation.  
- **Build a tool I could share**: Something thoughtful and original that others could explore.  
- **Push my solo dev boundaries**: Could I build and ship a semantic search product end-to-end? Turns out: yes.  
- **Reflect on meaning in an AI age**: And explore what gets lostâ€”or preservedâ€”when machines interact with human speech.

## What's Next

This post is the start of a full behind-the-scenes series on how I built it.

Coming up:
- How semantic search + GPT work together
- What it means to be a full-stack prompt engineer
- Challenges I ran intoâ€”and what surprised me
- Reflections on literariness, automation, and what AI leaves behind
