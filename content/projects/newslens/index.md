NewsLens is a side project exploring how major news stories evolve across media outlets. It captures headline snapshots from top news sites throughout the day, allowing for comparative analysis of framing, bias, and tone.

I'm building it to surface differences in media coverage and to experiment with visualizations, sentiment analysis, and AI-powered comparisons.
